Quiz game with numbers and riddles :D

Our predominant mission is to create a quiz game with riddles.

We want to have at least seven stages, each with increasing complexity, as well as a home screen, levels screen, and different screens for each level.

Our experience should be novel, and dig at a player's critical thinking skills and ability to think outside of the box.
