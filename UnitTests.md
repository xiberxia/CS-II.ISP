<h1>Unit Testing Concepts</h1>

<h2>1. Unit Tests</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Unit tests are automated tests that validate the correctness of individual units or components of a software system.</strong></p>
<p>We will test our game by playing it and looking to see if the score adds up correctly.</p>

<h2>2. Unit Test Cases</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Unit test cases are specific scenarios or conditions used to verify the correct behavior of a particular unit.</strong></p>
<p>First, we will see if the questions/answers work well by only testing the question screen of the game. We will observe if the correct answer is actually displayed as correct.</p>
<p>Next, we will test the score by answering different questions and tracking and calculating the score to see if it adds up correctly.</p>

<h2>3. Test Results and Logs</h2>
<p>We will log all test results and report them into an md file in GitHub and commit every change.</p>
