<h1>Unit Testing Concepts</h1>

<h2>1. Unit Tests</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Unit tests are automated tests that validate the correctness of individual units or components of a software system.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> They help ensure that each unit of the software performs as designed.</p>

<h2>2. Unit Test Cases</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Unit test cases are specific scenarios or conditions used to verify the correct behavior of a particular unit.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> They serve as the detailed specifications for testing the functionality of individual units.</p>

<h2>3. Testing Frameworks</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Testing frameworks are tools that provide a structure for writing, organizing, and running unit tests. They often include features for test setup, execution, and result reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> JUnit (Java), NUnit (C#), pytest (Python), and TestNG (Java).</p>

<h2>4. Test Coverage Reports</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Test coverage reports measure the extent to which the codebase is exercised by the unit tests. It helps identify areas of code that are not covered by tests.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To ensure comprehensive testing and identify potential gaps in the test suite.</p>

<h2>5. Mock Objects and Test Doubles</h2>
<p><strong>Mock Objects:</strong> Objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled manner during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Test Doubles:</strong> General term for objects used in unit tests as replacements for dependencies, such as mocks, stubs, fakes, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To isolate the unit being tested and control the environment to focus on specific scenarios.</p>

<h2>6. Test Results and Logs</h2>
<p><strong>Test Results:</strong> The outcome of running unit tests, indicating whether the units passed or failed.</p>
<p><strong>Logs:</strong> Information recorded during the test execution, including details about test cases, any errors encountered, and other relevant information.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To provide feedback on the success or failure of tests and assist in diagnosing issues.</p>
