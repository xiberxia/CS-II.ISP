Source code

When we make a game, we will use Python code, and our version controlled repository is GitHub.

We will use Python code like that: 

import random

# Define a list of questions and their corresponding answers
questions = [
    {
        "question": "What is the next number ( 1, 11, 88, 101, ?",
        "options": ["A) 100", "B) 102", "C) 108", "D) 111"],
        "answer": "D"
    }
]

# ask a random question and get the user's answer
def ask_question(question):
    print(question["question"])
    for option in question["options"]:
        print(option)
    user_answer = input("Your answer (A/B/C/D): ").upper()
    return user_answer

# Chech the user's answer
def check_answer(question, user_answer):
    return user_answer == question["answer"]
