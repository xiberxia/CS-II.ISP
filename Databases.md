<h1>Databases</h1>
<h2>What are databases?</h2>
<p>Databases are used to store data. Duh. But, in the case of games, they are usually used to store a user's login data, and more applicable to our ISP, progression in games, and can be stored both locally or on cloud.</p>
<h2>Will we be using databases?</h2>
<p>Likely not. All gameplay data will be deleted upon exiting the game, like how an accountless Coolmathgames player would have all of their progress reset upon closing the necessary tab. Storing all players' accounts on a github repository will also be troublesome, and since the game is so simple, people can simply play back their progress if they wish to continue gameplay.</p>
